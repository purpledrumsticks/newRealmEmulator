This is a site to display some of the things that I have created using playfuljs. Check out the repo I used
to make these projects here: https://github.com/hunterloftis/playfuljs-demos

newRealmsEmulator was inspired by the playstation one game "LSD: Dream Emulator". It is less complete than
the game that it was inspired by. The music was produced by myself. Some of the images I used do not belong to me and
will be removed if I am asked to do so.
